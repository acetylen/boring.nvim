# Boring.nvim - a lua theme based on vim-colors-plain

`boring` is a very plain theme, inspired by the `plain-cterm` theme from
`vim-colors-plain`. It's cterm-only by choice, but can be easily modified into
a true colour theme if you so desire. I don't.

The theme is developed for a light background, so changing the accent colour
may be needed if you use a dark background.
