# Boring.nvim

`boring` is a very plain Neovim theme, inspired by the `plain-cterm` theme
from [`vim-colors-plain`](https://github.com/andreypopp/vim-colors-plain)
but rewritten in Lua.
It's cterm-only (e.g. it uses whatever colours are configured in your
terminal), but can be easily modified into a truecolour theme if you
so desire. I don't.

Support for some plugins and languages have been added, but I probably won't
add more.

The theme is developed for a light background, so changing the accent colour
may be needed if you use a dark background.

## Usage

Install with package manager of choice, then `colorscheme boring`.

## Preview

Font is GoMono. Terminal is kitty. Background color is #FFF8F0 (set in terminal, not in theme)
