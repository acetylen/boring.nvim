# Boring.nvim - a lua theme with no colors

`boring` is a very plain theme, inspired by the `plain-cterm` theme from
[`vim-colors-plain`](https://github.com/andreypopp/vim-colors-plain).
It's cterm-only by choice, but can be easily modified into a true colour
theme if you so desire. I don't.

There are no officially supported plugins, but a lot of commented-out groups
that you can use to add support.

The theme is developed for a light background, so changing the accent colour
may be needed if you use a dark background.

## Usage

Install with package manager of choice, then `colorscheme boring`.
