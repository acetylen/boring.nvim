# Boring.nvim - a lua theme with no colors

`boring` is a very plain Neovim theme, inspired by the `plain-cterm` theme
from [`vim-colors-plain`](https://github.com/andreypopp/vim-colors-plain).
It's cterm-only by choice, but can be easily modified into a true colour
theme if you so desire. I don't.

Support for some plugins and languages have been added, but I probably won't
add more.

The theme is developed for a light background, so changing the accent colour
may be needed if you use a dark background.

## Usage

Install with package manager of choice, then `colorscheme boring`.

## Preview

Font is GoMono. Terminal is kitty. Background color is #FFF8F0 (not part of the theme, but what it was developed with)
